This final project for INST 326 uses the SpaceX Web API to get upcoming launches and their payloads. It also gives a breakdown of the types of payloads as well. 

The spotify module contains classes for interacting with the SpaceX Web API and for modeling upcoming launches, payloads for each launch, and the number of each type of payload.
